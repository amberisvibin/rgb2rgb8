# rgb2rgb8

rgb2rgb8 is a program that converts files containing 24 bit RGB hex codes into files containing 8 bit 3-3-2 RGB hex codes (converted to 24 bit for ease of use).

This allows the user to convert 24 bit RGB palettes to 8 bit palettes.

This has been tested with .hex palettes from [Lospec](https://lospec.com/palette-list)
